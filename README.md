Todo is a mobile application developed using Flutter SDK for Android and iOS devices. It is allows user to register themselves in a local database stored on their devices and further log in to the app. Users can create a list of Todo objects and mark them as done. They can also delete the objects as they like.

Todo utilises SQLite database which stores the user information and Todo object information in SQL tables.
